                <p class="bio">
                I'm Irish and currently live in Salford, where I have been based since moving to Manchester for university in 2009. 
                I'm currently learning to code via the Command Shift Bootcamp, my goal is to change my career and become a Software Developer.

                I have two guinea pigs called Ted and Dougal who spend most of their day napping and acting like they haven't just been fed.

        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <p>
        When I'm not learning to code, I enjoy reading (mostly historical non-fiction as I studied this at university). I love to travel, particularly anywhere spooky or to see animals. 
        I've recently taken up running again and hope to finally complete the couch to 5k app (for the fourth time) this year. 
        When the weather is nice you can find me trying not to fall over on my rollerskates around Manchester.

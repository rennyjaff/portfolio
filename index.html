            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I'm Irish and currently live in Salford, where I have been based since moving to Manchester for university in 2009.
                    I have two guinea pigs called Ted and Dougal who spend most of their day napping and acting like they haven't just been fed.

                <p>I'm currently learning to code via the Command Shift Bootcamp. My goal is to change my career and become a Software Developer!
                    When I'm not learning to code I'm trying not to fall over on my rollerskates around Manchester.
